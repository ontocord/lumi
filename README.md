# lumi
Lumi means river in Albanian and contains code for doing VLT5 and minidalle, which in turn are trimmed down versions of: https://github.com/j-min/VL-T5 and https://github.com/kuprel/min-dalle respectively, both of which are under the MIT license, with components under the Apache license. The intended use of this directory is to distill image-langauge models and to create synthetic image-langauge data.
